Darling you faded on me
Darling you faded on me

Don't fade on me
You come out of the blues all them times by yourself
Nothing lives for nothing
And that goes for pain and goes for everything else
But you faded on me
You faded on me
Don't fade on me

You come out okay through the worst of it all
One star still standing
You make the final wish
For the world when it falls
It's fading faster on you
Faster on you
Don't fade on me

Even that tired old moon has finally come back to town
And she's been asking for you
And I thought that no one lived for nothing now
Even Christ stayed until he had run out of doubt
But you faded on me
You faded on me
You faded on me
You faded on me
You faded on me
You faded on me
